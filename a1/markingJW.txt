CISC/CMPE 457 Assignment 1

0. runs without error

   1/1 no errors 

  TA comments:



1. applyBrightnessAndContrast

   1/1 Modify only component 0 of the pixel (i.e. the Y value)

   0.5/1 Compute newY = oldY * contrast + brightness and clamp to [0,255].

   TA comments:
	did not clamp to [0,255].


2. performHistoEqualization

   0/1 Store the calculated values in a separate image so as not to
      affect the current calculation

   0.5/1 Use the correct neighbourhood

   1/1 Correctly handle pixels outside the image with either
      (a) clamping to image border and counting or (b) not counting at all

   1/1 Calculate the new value as "256 / count * num_less - 1", where
      "count" is the number of pixels in the neighbourhood and
      "num_less" is the number of pixels less than OR EQUAL TO to
      centre pixel (can use 235-16+1 instead of 256 if they wish, even
      though it's wrong)

   TA comments:
	you did sotre y seperately, but still changed pixel in the loops as calculation is still going on.
	the neighbourhood using range need to include +1, maxX = min(width - 1, x + radius +1)
	


3. scaleImage

   1/1 Detect and handle source pixels from outside the image
      (i.e. make them white or black)

   0.5/1 Use backward projection and scale about the centre


   TA comments:
	did not center


4. Deductions for lateness:

   0/0

   TA comments: 



Total

   6.5/9
